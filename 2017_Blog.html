                                <h2>Control and Control, in general</h2>
                                <h4>Feb 2017</h4>
                                Making my first entry here. I love writing in notebook and reading hardcover books. Lately, I am getting into meditation. I was doing it on and off but looks like this time, I am sticking to it and honestly, I did not realize when I got the habit of it.
                                Speaking of meditation, one can not stop about thinking and controlling thoughts. The reason I was resisting (was I?, dont know) meditation was, I had a very different feeling about it, like I need some kind of help to get through my life. I will write more about it later.
                                <br />
                                I must admit, the <a href="https://www.headspace.com/" target="_blank">headspace </a> program is really good. Well, at least from what I have tried so far. A good course for doing the guided meditation.
                                <br /><br />
                                It got me thinking about getting control over thoughts. We all know, its difficult. I am not sure why everyone says it’s "difficult" and not impossible. I haven't met anyone who has honestly admitted that they have complete control over what they can and cannot think. May be I need to get deeper into this.  A quick search on internet gives millions of books and blogs that gives strategies on controlling your thoughts, but who has validated it if it really works?
                                <br /><br />
                                I am forming an opinion that controlling one’s thought is not binary - you can try but I haven’t came across anyone who can describe what is the thoughtless experience like. I assume, when the state of no thought is achieved, one must think that there are no thoughts.
                                <br />
                                I am also dwelling on what things you can control in your life. When I think about it, they are very few. Like how you spend your time (that too, when you are bachelor). What you eat & your habits  (to certain extent what your health allows). Other things in your life is direct reflection of your thoughts, knowledge and actions that you have done so far. Again, inception of any action is a thought!<br /><br />
                                Other throught that comes to me is, well, you can control what you do. You can not control what happens to you. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Subtle-Art-Not-Giving-Counterintuitive/dp/0062457713/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1488002556&sr=8-1&keywords=subtle+art+of+not+giving" target="_blank">“Subtle art of not giving f*ck”</a> is a nice book and I like Mark’s thoughts. You can only interpret or change your perspective on what is happening to you. From that perspective, there is a limit to what events that happen to you can be taken positively - intellectually and emotionally.
                                <br /><br />
                                May be human mind is designed or evolved like this? And that is a good thing? Is it one of those things that is not meant to be controlled?
                                <br /><br />
                                Lastly, I couldn’t control millions of thought that came to me when I was making this entry :)
